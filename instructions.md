- Use existing tools or MCP when available instead of creating new solutions
- Check if project has virtual environment (venv/.venv) - if exists, activate it first
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets - use environment variables
- Check if localStorage/sessionStorage is supported in current environment before using
- Check dependencies are installed (show pip install or npm install commands if missing)
- Use cross-platform path handling (path.join) unless OS is explicitly specified
